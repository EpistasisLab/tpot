An example command-line call to TPOT may look like:

```Shell

```

# TPOT with code

We've taken care to design the TPOT interface to be as similar as possible to scikit-learn.

TPOT can be imported just like any regular Python module. To import TPOT, type:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier
```

then create an instance of TPOT as follows:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier()
```

It's also possible to use TPOT for regression problems with the `TPOTRegressor` class. Other than the class name, a `TPOTRegressor` is used the same way as a `TPOTClassifier`.

Note that you can pass several parameters to the TPOT instantiation call:

Some example code with custom TPOT parameters might look like:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5,
                                    random_state=42, verbosity=2)
```

Now TPOT is ready to optimize a pipeline for you. You can tell TPOT to optimize a pipeline based on a data set with the `fit` function:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5,
                                    random_state=42, verbosity=2)
pipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)
```

The `fit()` function takes in a training data set and uses k-fold cross-validation when evaluating pipelines. It then initializes the genetic programming algoritm to find the best pipeline based on average k-fold score.

You can then proceed to evaluate the final pipeline on the testing set with the `score()` function:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5,
                                    random_state=42, verbosity=2)
pipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)
print(pipeline_optimizer.score(testing_features, testing_classes))
```

Finally, you can tell TPOT to export the corresponding Python code for the optimized pipeline to a text file with the `export()` function:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5,
                                    random_state=42, verbosity=2)
pipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)
print(pipeline_optimizer.score(testing_features, testing_classes))
pipeline_optimizer.export('tpot_exported_pipeline.py')
```

Once this code finishes running, `tpot_exported_pipeline.py` will contain the Python code for the optimized pipeline.

Check our [examples](examples/) to see TPOT applied to some specific data sets.

## Scoring functions

TPOT makes use of `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score` for evaluating pipelines, and as such offers the same support for scoring functions. There are two ways to make use of scoring functions with TPOT:

1. You can pass in a string to the `scoring` parameter from the list above. Any other strings will cause TPOT to throw an exception.

2. You can pass a function with the signature `scorer(y_true, y_pred)`, where `y_true` are the true target values and `y_pred` are the predicted target values from an estimator. To do this, you should implement your own function. See the example below for further explanation.

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

digits = load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target,
                                                    train_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)

def accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return float(sum(y_pred == y_true)) / len(y_true)

tpot = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, verbosity=2,
                      scoring=accuracy)
tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))
tpot.export('tpot_mnist_pipeline.py')
```

<a name="builtinconfig"></a>
## Built-in TPOT configurations

TPOT comes with a handful of default operators and parameter configurations that we believe work well for optimizing machine learning pipelines. Below is a list of the current built-in configurations that come with TPOT.

<table>
<tr>
<th align="left">Configuration Name</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
<th align="left">Operators</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Default TPOT</td>
<td>TPOT will search over a broad range of preprocessors, feature constructors, feature selectors, models, and parameters to find a series of operators that minimize the error of the model predictions. Some of these operators are complex and may take a long time to run, especially on larger datasets.
<br /><br />
<strong>Note: This is the default configuration for TPOT.</strong> To use this configuration, use the default value for the config_dict parameter.</td>
<td align="center"><a href="https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_classifier.py">Classification</a>
<br /><br />
<a href="https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_regressor.py">Regression</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TPOT light</td>
<td>TPOT will search over a restricted range of preprocessors, feature constructors, feature selectors, models, and parameters to find a series of operators that minimize the error of the model predictions. Only simpler and fast-running operators will be used in these pipelines, so TPOT light is useful for finding quick and simple pipelines for a classification or regression problem.
<br /><br />
This configuration works for both the TPOTClassifier and TPOTRegressor.</td>
<td align="center"><a href="https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_classifier_light.py">Classification</a>
<br /><br />
<a href="https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_regressor_light.py">Regression</a></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>TPOT MDR</td>
<td>TPOT will search over a series of feature selectors and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifactor_dimensionality_reduction">Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction</a> models to find a series of operators that maximize classification accuracy. The TPOT MDR configuration is specialized for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study">genome-wide association studies (GWAS)</a>, and is described in detail online <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01780">here</a>.
<br /><br />
Note that TPOT MDR may be slow to run because the feature selection routines are computationally expensive, especially on large datasets.
<br /><br />
This configuration currently works only for the TPOTClassifier.</td>
<td align="center"><a href="https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_classifier_mdr.py">Classification</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

To use any of these configurations, simply pass the string name of the configuration to the `config_dict` parameter (or `-config` on the command line). For example, to use the "TPOT light" configuration:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

digits = load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target,
                                                    train_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)

tpot = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, verbosity=2,
                      config_dict='TPOT light')
tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))
tpot.export('tpot_mnist_pipeline.py')

```

<a name="customconfig"></a>
## Customizing TPOT's operators and parameters

Beyond the default configurations that come with TPOT, in some cases it is useful to limit the algorithms and parameters that TPOT considers. For that reason, we allow users to provide TPOT with a custom configuration for its operators and parameters.

The custom TPOT configuration must be in nested dictionary format, where the first level key is the path and name of the operator (e.g., `sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB`) and the second level key is the corresponding parameter name for that operator (e.g., `fit_prior`). The second level key should point to a list of parameter values for that parameter, e.g., `'fit_prior': [True, False]`.

For a simple example, the configuration could be:

```Python
tpot_config = {
    'sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB': {
    },

    'sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB': {
        'alpha': [1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1., 10., 100.],
        'fit_prior': [True, False]
    },

    'sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB': {
        'alpha': [1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1., 10., 100.],
        'fit_prior': [True, False]
    }
}
```

in which case TPOT would only consider pipelines containing `GaussianNB`, `BernoulliNB`, `MultinomialNB`, and tune those algorithm's parameters in the ranges provided. This dictionary can be passed directly within the code to the `TPOTClassifier`/`TPOTRegressor` `config_dict` parameter, described above. For example:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

digits = load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target,
                                                    train_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)

tpot_config = {
    'sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB': {
    },

    'sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB': {
        'alpha': [1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1., 10., 100.],
        'fit_prior': [True, False]
    },

    'sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB': {
        'alpha': [1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1., 10., 100.],
        'fit_prior': [True, False]
    }
}

tpot = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, verbosity=2,
                      config_dict=tpot_config)
tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))
tpot.export('tpot_mnist_pipeline.py')
```

Command-line users must create a separate `.py` file with the custom configuration and provide the path to the file to the `tpot` call. For example, if the simple example configuration above is saved in `tpot_classifier_config.py`, that configuration could be used on the command line with the command:

```
tpot data/mnist.csv -is , -target class -config tpot_classifier_config.py -g 5 -p 20 -v 2 -o tpot_exported_pipeline.py
```

When using the command-line interface, the configuration file specified in the `-config` parameter *must* name its custom TPOT config `tpot_config`. Otherwise, TPOT will not be able to locate the dictionary.

For more detailed examples of how to customize TPOT's operator configuration, see the default configurations for [classification](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_classifier.py) and [regression](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/tpot/config_regressor.py) in TPOT's source code.

Note that you must have all of the corresponding packages for the operators installed on your computer, otherwise TPOT will not be able to use them. For example, if XGBoost is not installed on your computer, then TPOT will simply not import nor use XGBoost in the pipelines it considers.
