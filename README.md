TPOT stands for Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool. TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. Consider TPOT your Data Science Assistant.

## Contributors

TPOT recently went through a major refactoring. The package was rewritten from scratch to improve efficiency and performance, support new features, and fix numerous bugs. New features include genetic feature selection, a significantly expanded and more flexible method of defining search spaces, multi-objective optimization, a more modular framework allowing for easier customization of the evolutionary algorithm, and more. While in development, this new version was referred to as "TPOT2" but we have now merged what was once TPOT2 into the main TPOT package. You can learn more about this new version of TPOT in our GPTP paper titled "TPOT2: A New Graph-Based Implementation of the Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool for Automated Machine Learning."

The current version of TPOT was developed at Cedars-Sinai by:  
    - Pedro Henrique Ribeiro (Lead developer - https://github.com/perib, https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-ribeiro/)  
    - Anil Saini (anil.saini@cshs.org)

    - Miguel E. Hernandez (miguel.e.hernandez@cshs.org)  
    - Jason Moore (moorejh28@gmail.com)  

The original version of TPOT was primarily developed at the University of Pennsylvania by:  
    - Randal S. Olson (rso@randalolson.com)  
    - Weixuan Fu (weixuanf@upenn.edu)

## Documentation

[The documentation webpage can be found here.](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/)

We also recommend looking at the Tutorials folder for jupyter notebooks with examples and guides.

## Installation

TPOT requires a working installation of Python.

### Creating a conda environment (optional)

We recommend using conda environments for installing TPOT, though it would work equally well if manually installed without it.

[More information on making anaconda environments found here.](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

```
conda create --name tpotenv python=3.10
conda activate tpotenv
```

### Packages Used

python version >=3.10, <3.14
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn
update_checker
tqdm
stopit
pandas
joblib
xgboost
matplotlib
traitlets
lightgbm
optuna
jupyter
networkx
dask
distributed
dask-ml
dask-jobqueue
func_timeout
configspace

Many of the hyperparameter ranges used in our configspaces were adapted from either the original TPOT package or the AutoSklearn package. 

### Note for M1 Mac or other Arm-based CPU users

You need to install the lightgbm package directly from conda using the following command before installing TPOT. 

This is to ensure that you get the version that is compatible with your system.

```
conda install --yes -c conda-forge 'lightgbm>=3.3.3'
```

### Installing Extra Features with pip

If you want to utilize the additional features provided by TPOT along with `scikit-learn` extensions, you can install them using `pip`. The command to install TPOT with these extra features is as follows:

```
pip install tpot[sklearnex]
```

Please note that while these extensions can speed up scikit-learn packages, there are some important considerations:

These extensions may not be fully developed and tested on Arm-based CPUs, such as M1 Macs. You might encounter compatibility issues or reduced performance on such systems.

We recommend using Python 3.9 when installing these extra features, as it provides better compatibility and stability.


### Developer/Latest Branch Installation


```
pip install -e /path/to/tpotrepo
```

If you downloaded with git pull, then the repository folder will be named TPOT. (Note: this folder is the one that includes setup.py inside of it and not the folder of the same name inside it).
If you downloaded as a zip, the folder may be called tpot-main. 


## Usage 

See the Tutorials Folder for more instructions and examples.

### Best Practices

#### 1 
TPOT uses dask for parallel processing. When Python is parallelized, each module is imported within each processes. Therefore it is important to protect all code within a `if __name__ == "__main__"` when running TPOT from a script. This is not required when running TPOT from a notebook.

For example:

```
#my_analysis.py

import tpot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    X, y = load_my_data()
    est = tpot.TPOTClassifier()
    est.fit(X,y)
    #rest of analysis
```

#### 2

When designing custom objective functions, avoid the use of global variables.

Don't Do:
```
global_X = [[1,2],[4,5]]
global_y = [0,1]
def foo(est):
    return my_scorer(est, X=global_X, y=global_y)

```

Instead use a partial

```
from functools import partial

def foo_scorer(est, X, y):
    return my_scorer(est, X, y)

if __name__=='__main__':
    X = [[1,2],[4,5]]
    y = [0,1]
    final_scorer = partial(foo_scorer, X=X, y=y)
```

Similarly when using lambda functions.

Dont Do:

```
def new_objective(est, a, b)
    #definition

a = 100
b = 20
bad_function = lambda est :  new_objective(est=est, a=a, b=b)
```

Do:
```
def new_objective(est, a, b)
    #definition

a = 100
b = 20
good_function = lambda est, a=a, b=b : new_objective(est=est, a=a, b=b)
```

### Tips

TPOT will not check if your data is correctly formatted. It will assume that you have passed in operators that can handle the type of data that was passed in. For instance, if you pass in a pandas dataframe with categorical features and missing data, then you should also include in your configuration operators that can handle those feautures of the data. Alternatively, if you pass in `preprocessing = True`, TPOT will impute missing values, one hot encode categorical features, then standardize the data. (Note that this is currently fitted and transformed on the entire training set before splitting for CV. Later there will be an option to apply per fold, and have the parameters be learnable.)


Setting `verbose` to 5 can be helpful during debugging as it will print out the error generated by failing pipelines.
