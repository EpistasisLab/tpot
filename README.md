Consider TPOT your **Data Science Assistant**. TPOT is a Python tool that automatically creates and optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

![TPOT Demo](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/images/tpot-demo.gif "TPOT Demo")

TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.

![An example Machine Learning pipeline](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/images/tpot-ml-pipeline.png "An example Machine Learning pipeline")

<p align="center"><strong>An example Machine Learning pipeline</strong></p>

Once TPOT is finished searching (or you get tired of waiting), it provides you with the Python code for the best pipeline it found so you can tinker with the pipeline from there.

![An example TPOT pipeline](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/images/tpot-pipeline-example.png "An example TPOT pipeline")

TPOT is built on top of scikit-learn, so all of the code it generates should look familiar... if you're familiar with scikit-learn, anyway.

**TPOT is still under active development** and we encourage you to check back on this repository regularly for updates.

For further information about TPOT, please see the [project documentation](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/).

## License

Please see the [repository license](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/blob/master/LICENSE) for the licensing and usage information for TPOT.

Generally, we have licensed TPOT to make it as widely usable as possible.

## Installation

We maintain the [TPOT installation instructions](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/installing/) in the documentation. TPOT requires a working installation of Python.

## Usage

TPOT can be used [on the command line](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/using/#tpot-on-the-command-line) or [with Python code](http://rhiever.github.io/tpot/using/#tpot-with-code).

Click on the corresponding links to find more information on TPOT usage in the documentation.

## Example

Below is a minimal working example with the practice MNIST data set.

```python
from tpot import TPOT
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

digits = load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target,
                                                    train_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)

tpot = TPOT(generations=5)
tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))
tpot.export('tpot_mnist_pipeline.py')
```

Running this code should discover a pipeline that achieves ~98% testing accuracy, and the corresponding Python code should be exported to the `tpot_mnist_pipeline.py` file and look similar to the following:

```python
import numpy as np

from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# NOTE: Make sure that the class is labeled 'class' in the data file
tpot_data = np.recfromcsv('PATH/TO/DATA/FILE', sep='COLUMN_SEPARATOR')
features = tpot_data.view((np.float64, len(tpot_data.dtype.names)))
features = np.delete(features, tpot_data.dtype.names.index('class'), axis=1)
training_features, testing_features, training_classes, testing_classes =     train_test_split(features, tpot_data['class'], random_state=42)

exported_pipeline = make_pipeline(
    LogisticRegression(C=1.0, dual=True, penalty="l1")
)

exported_pipeline.fit(training_features, training_classes)
results = exported_pipeline.predict(testing_features)
```

## Support for TPOT

TPOT was developed in the [Computational Genetics Lab](http://epistasis.org) with funding from the [NIH](http://www.nih.gov). We're incredibly grateful for their support during the development of this project.

The TPOT logo was designed by Todd Newmuis, who generously donated his time to the project.
