TPOT was developed in the [Computational Genetics Lab](http://epistasis.org/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) with funding from the [NIH](http://www.nih.gov/) under grant R01 AI117694. We are incredibly grateful for the support of the NIH and the University of Pennsylvania during the development of this project.

The TPOT logo was designed by Todd Newmuis, who generously donated his time to the project.
