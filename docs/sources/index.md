# Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT)

Consider TPOT your **Data Science Assistant**. TPOT is a Python tool that automatically creates and optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

TPOT will automate the most tedious part of machine learning by intelligently exploring thousands of possible pipelines to find the best one for your data.

Once TPOT is finished searching (or you get tired of waiting), it provides you with the Python code for the best pipeline it found so you can tinker with the pipeline from there.

TPOT is built on top of scikit-learn, so all of the code it generates should look familiar... if you're familiar with scikit-learn, anyway.

**TPOT is still under active development** and we encourage you to check back on this repository regularly for updates.
