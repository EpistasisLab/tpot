# Installation instructions

TPOT is built on top of several existing Python libraries, including:

* NumPy

* SciPy

* pandas

* scikit-learn

* DEAP

Except for DEAP, all of the necessary Python packages can be installed via the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which we strongly recommend that you use. We also strongly recommend that you use of Python 3 over Python 2 if you're given the choice.

NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn can be installed in Anaconda via the command:

```Shell
conda install numpy scipy pandas scikit-learn
```

DEAP, and TQDM (used for verbose TPOT runs) can be installed with `pip`
via the command:

```Shell
pip install deap tqdm
```

Optional: For OS X users who want to use OpenMP-enabled compilers to install XGBoost, gcc-5.x.x can be installed with Homebrew: `brew install gcc --without-multilib`.

Finally to install TPOT itself, run the following command:

```Shell
pip install tpot
```

Please [file a new issue](https://github.com/rhiever/tpot/issues/new) if you run into installation problems.
