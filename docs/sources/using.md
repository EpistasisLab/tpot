# TPOT on the command line

To use TPOT via the command line, enter the following command with a path to the data file:

```Shell
tpot /path_to/data_file.csv
```

TPOT offers several arguments that can be provided at the command line:

<table>

An example command-line call to TPOT may look like:

```Shell
tpot data/mnist.csv -is , -o tpot_exported_pipeline.py -g 5 -p 20 -cv 5 -s 42 -v 2
```

# TPOT with code

We've taken care to design the TPOT interface to be as similar as possible to scikit-learn.

TPOT can be imported just like any regular Python module. To import TPOT, type:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier
```

then create an instance of TPOT as follows:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier()
```

Note that you can pass several parameters to the TPOT instantiation call:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th width="15%">Valid values</th>

<td>Any positive integer</td>
<td>The number of generations to run pipeline optimization over. Generally, TPOT will work better when you give it more generations (and therefore time) to optimize over. TPOT will evaluate generations x population_size number of pipelines in total.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>population_size</td>
<td>Any positive integer</td>
<td>The number of individuals in the GP population. Generally, TPOT will work better when you give it more individuals (and therefore time) to optimize over. TPOT will evaluate generations x population_size number of pipelines in total.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mutation_rate</td>
<td>[0.0, 1.0]</td>
<td>The mutation rate for the genetic programming algorithm in the range [0.0, 1.0]. This tells the genetic programming algorithm how many pipelines to apply random changes to every generation. We don't recommend that you tweak this parameter unless you know what you're doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>[0.0, 1.0]</td>

Some example code with custom TPOT parameters might look like:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5, random_state=42, verbosity=2)
```

Now TPOT is ready to optimize a pipeline for you. You can tell TPOT to optimize a pipeline based on a data set with the `fit` function:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5, random_state=42, verbosity=2)
pipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)
```

The `fit()` function takes in a training data set and uses k-fold cross-validation when evaluating pipelines. It then initializes the genetic programming algoritm to find the best pipeline based on average k-fold score.

You can then proceed to evaluate the final pipeline on the testing set with the `score()` function:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5, random_state=42, verbosity=2)
pipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)
print(pipeline_optimizer.score(testing_features, testing_classes))
```

Finally, you can tell TPOT to export the corresponding Python code for the optimized pipeline to a text file with the `export()` function:

```Python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

pipeline_optimizer = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5, random_state=42, verbosity=2)
pipeline_optimizer.fit(training_features, training_classes)
print(pipeline_optimizer.score(testing_features, testing_classes))
pipeline_optimizer.export('tpot_exported_pipeline.py')
```

Once this code finishes running, `tpot_exported_pipeline.py` will contain the Python code for the optimized pipeline.

Check our [examples](examples/MNIST_Example/) to see TPOT applied to some specific data sets.

### Scoring Functions

TPOT makes use of `sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score`, and as such has the same support for scoring functions. There are two ways to make use of scoring functions with TPOT:

1. You can pass in a string from the list described in the table above. Any other strings will cause internal issues that may break your code down the line.

2. You can pass in a function with the signature `scorer(y_true, y_pred)` that takes in a scikit-learn estimator (so in TPOT's case, a pipeline that you can call methods like `predict()` on. To do this, you should implement your own function. See the example below for further explanation.

```Python
def accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    return float(sum(y_pred == y_true)) / len(y_true)
```
