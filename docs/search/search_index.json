It must be a positive number or None. If None, the parameter max_time_mins must be defined as the runtime limit.  Generally, TPOT will work better when you give it more generations (and therefore time) to optimize the pipeline.  TPOT will evaluate population_size + generations \u00d7 offspring_size pipelines in total.  population_size: int, optional (default=100)  Number of individuals to retain in the genetic programming population every generation. Must be a positive number.  Generally, TPOT will work better when you give it more individuals with which to optimize the pipeline.  offspring_size: int, optional (default=None)  Number of offspring to produce in each genetic programming generation. Must be a positive number. By default, the number of offspring is equal to the number of population size.  mutation_rate: float, optional (default=0.9)  Mutation rate for the genetic programming algorithm in the range [0.0, 1.0]. This parameter tells the GP algorithm how many pipelines to apply random changes to every generation.  mutation_rate + crossover_rate cannot exceed 1.0.  We recommend using the default parameter unless you understand how the mutation rate affects GP algorithms.  crossover_rate: float, optional (default=0.1)  Crossover rate for the genetic programming algorithm in the range [0.0, 1.0]. This parameter tells the genetic programming algorithm how many pipelines to \"breed\" every generation.  mutation_rate + crossover_rate cannot exceed 1.0.  We recommend using the default parameter unless you understand how the crossover rate affects GP algorithms.  scoring: string or callable, optional (default='accuracy')  Function used to evaluate the quality of a given pipeline for the classification problem.

TPOT will stop earlier if generations is set and all generations are already evaluated.  max_eval_time_mins: float, optional (default=5)  How many minutes TPOT has to evaluate a single pipeline.  Setting this parameter to higher values will allow TPOT to evaluate more complex pipelines, but will also allow TPOT to run longer. Use this parameter to help prevent TPOT from wasting time on evaluating time-consuming pipelines.  random_state: integer or None, optional (default=None)  The seed of the pseudo random number generator used in TPOT.  Use this parameter to make sure that TPOT will give you the same results each time you run it against the same data set with that seed.  config_dict: Python dictionary, string, or None, optional (default=None)  A configuration dictionary for customizing the operators and parameters that TPOT searches in the optimization process.

See the  template option in tpot section for more details.  warm_start: boolean, optional (default=False)  Flag indicating whether the TPOT instance will reuse the population from previous calls to fit().  Setting warm_start=True can be useful for running TPOT for a short time on a dataset, checking the results, then resuming the TPOT run from where it left off.  memory: a joblib.Memory object or string, optional (default=None)  If supplied, pipeline will cache each transformer after calling fit. This feature is used to avoid computing the fit transformers within a pipeline if the parameters and input data are identical with another fitted pipeline during optimization process. More details about memory caching in scikit-learn documentation  Possible inputs are: <ul> <li>String 'auto': TPOT uses memory caching with a temporary directory and cleans it up upon shutdown, or</li> <li>Path of a caching directory, TPOT uses memory caching with the provided directory and TPOT does NOT clean the caching directory up upon shutdown, or</li> <li>Memory object, TPOT uses the instance of joblib.Memory for memory caching and TPOT does NOT clean the caching directory up upon shutdown, or</li> <li>None, TPOT does not use memory caching.</li> </ul> use_dask: boolean, optional (default: False)  Whether to use Dask-ML's pipeline optimiziations.

See avoid repeated work for more details.  periodic_checkpoint_folder: path string, optional (default: None)  If supplied, a folder in which TPOT will periodically save pipelines in pareto front so far while optimizing. Currently once per generation but not more often than once per 30 seconds.

The update checker will tell you when a new version of TPOT has been released.  log_file: file-like class (io.TextIOWrapper or io.StringIO) or string, optional (default: None)   Save progress content to a file. If it is a string for the path and file name of the desired output file, TPOT will create the file and write log into it.

This attribute is primarily for internal use, but may be useful for looking at the other pipelines that TPOT evaluated.  <p>Example</p> <pre><code>from tpot import TPOTClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_digits\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ndigits = load_digits()\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target,\ntrain_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)\ntpot = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=50, verbosity=2)\ntpot.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))\ntpot.export('tpot_digits_pipeline.py')\n</code></pre> <p>Functions</p> fit(features, classes[, sample_weight, groups]) Run the TPOT optimization process on the given training data. predict(features) Use the optimized pipeline to predict the classes for a feature set. predict_proba(features) Use the optimized pipeline to estimate the class probabilities for a feature set. score(testing_features, testing_classes) Returns the optimized pipeline's score on the given testing data using the user-specified scoring function. export(output_file_name) Export the optimized pipeline as Python code. <p> <pre><code>fit(features, classes, sample_weight=None, groups=None)\n</code></pre></p>  Run the TPOT optimization process on the given training data.  Uses genetic programming to optimize a machine learning pipeline that maximizes the score on the provided features and target. This pipeline optimization procedure uses internal k-fold cross-validaton to avoid overfitting on the provided data. At the end of the pipeline optimization procedure, the best pipeline is then trained on the entire set of provided samples.  Parameters: features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix  TPOT and all scikit-learn algorithms assume that the features will be numerical and there will be no missing values. As such, when a feature matrix is provided to TPOT, all missing values will automatically be replaced (i.e., imputed) using median value imputation.  If you wish to use a different imputation strategy than median imputation, please make sure to apply imputation to your feature set prior to passing it to TPOT.  classes: array-like {n_samples}  List of class labels for prediction  sample_weight: array-like {n_samples}, optional  Per-sample weights. Higher weights indicate more importance. If specified, sample_weight will be passed to any pipeline element whose fit() function accepts a sample_weight argument. By default, using sample_weight does not affect tpot's scoring functions, which determine preferences between pipelines.  groups: array-like, with shape {n_samples, }, optional  Group labels for the samples used when performing cross-validation.  This parameter should only be used in conjunction with sklearn's Group cross-validation functions, such as sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold.  Returns: self: object  Returns a copy of the fitted TPOT object  <p> <pre><code>predict(features)\n</code></pre></p>  Use the optimized pipeline to predict the classes for a feature set.  Parameters: features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix  Returns: predictions: array-like {n_samples}  Predicted classes for the samples in the feature matrix  <p> <pre><code>predict_proba(features)\n</code></pre></p>  Use the optimized pipeline to estimate the class probabilities for a feature set.  Note: This function will only work for pipelines whose final classifier supports the predict_proba function. TPOT will raise an error otherwise.  Parameters: features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix  Returns: predictions: array-like {n_samples, n_classes}  The class probabilities of the input samples  <p> <pre><code>score(testing_features, testing_classes)\n</code></pre></p>  Returns the optimized pipeline's score on the given testing data using the user-specified scoring function.  The default scoring function for TPOTClassifier is 'accuracy'.  Parameters: testing_features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix of the testing set  testing_classes: array-like {n_samples}  List of class labels for prediction in the testing set  Returns: accuracy_score: float  The estimated test set accuracy according to the user-specified scoring function.  <p> <pre><code>export(output_file_name, data_file_path)\n</code></pre></p>  Export the optimized pipeline as Python code.  See the usage documentation for example usage of the export function.  Parameters: output_file_name: string  String containing the path and file name of the desired output file  data_file_path: string  By default, the path of input dataset is 'PATH/TO/DATA/FILE' by default. If data_file_path is another string, the path will be replaced.  Returns: exported_code_string: string  The whole pipeline text as a string should be returned if output_file_name is not specified."},{"location":"api/#regression","title":"Regression","text":"<pre>class tpot.TPOTRegressor(generations=100, population_size=100,\n                         offspring_size=None, mutation_rate=0.9,\n                         crossover_rate=0.1,\n                         scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', cv=5,\n                         subsample=1.0, n_jobs=1,\n                         max_time_mins=None, max_eval_time_mins=5,\n                         random_state=None, config_dict=None,\n                         template=None,\n                         warm_start=False,\n                         memory=None,\n                         use_dask=False,\n                         periodic_checkpoint_folder=None,\n                         early_stop=None,\n                         verbosity=0,\n                         disable_update_check=False)</pre> source <p>Automated machine learning for supervised regression tasks.</p> <p>The TPOTRegressor performs an intelligent search over machine learning pipelines that can contain supervised regression models, preprocessors, feature selection techniques, and any other estimator or transformer that follows the scikit-learn API.

This attribute is primarily for internal use, but may be useful for looking at the other pipelines that TPOT evaluated.  <p>Example</p> <pre><code>from tpot import TPOTRegressor\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_boston\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\ndigits = load_boston()\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target,\ntrain_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)\ntpot = TPOTRegressor(generations=5, population_size=50, verbosity=2)\ntpot.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))\ntpot.export('tpot_boston_pipeline.py')\n</code></pre> <p>Functions</p> fit(features, target[, sample_weight, groups]) Run the TPOT optimization process on the given training data. predict(features) Use the optimized pipeline to predict the target values for a feature set. score(testing_features, testing_target) Returns the optimized pipeline's score on the given testing data using the user-specified scoring function. export(output_file_name) Export the optimized pipeline as Python code. <p> <pre><code>fit(features, target, sample_weight=None, groups=None)\n</code></pre></p>  Run the TPOT optimization process on the given training data.  Uses genetic programming to optimize a machine learning pipeline that maximizes the score on the provided features and target. This pipeline optimization procedure uses internal k-fold cross-validaton to avoid overfitting on the provided data. At the end of the pipeline optimization procedure, the best pipeline is then trained on the entire set of provided samples.  Parameters: features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix  TPOT and all scikit-learn algorithms assume that the features will be numerical and there will be no missing values. As such, when a feature matrix is provided to TPOT, all missing values will automatically be replaced (i.e., imputed) using median value imputation.  If you wish to use a different imputation strategy than median imputation, please make sure to apply imputation to your feature set prior to passing it to TPOT.  target: array-like {n_samples}  List of target labels for prediction  sample_weight: array-like {n_samples}, optional  Per-sample weights. Higher weights indicate more importance. If specified, sample_weight will be passed to any pipeline element whose fit() function accepts a sample_weight argument. By default, using sample_weight does not affect tpot's scoring functions, which determine preferences between pipelines.  groups: array-like, with shape {n_samples, }, optional  Group labels for the samples used when performing cross-validation.  This parameter should only be used in conjunction with sklearn's Group cross-validation functions, such as sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold.  Returns: self: object  Returns a copy of the fitted TPOT object  <p> <pre><code>predict(features)\n</code></pre></p>  Use the optimized pipeline to predict the target values for a feature set.  Parameters: features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix  Returns: predictions: array-like {n_samples}  Predicted target values for the samples in the feature matrix  <p> <pre><code>score(testing_features, testing_target)\n</code></pre></p>  Returns the optimized pipeline's score on the given testing data using the user-specified scoring function.  The default scoring function for TPOTRegressor is 'mean_squared_error'.  Parameters: testing_features: array-like {n_samples, n_features}  Feature matrix of the testing set  testing_target: array-like {n_samples}  List of target labels for prediction in the testing set  Returns: accuracy_score: float  The estimated test set accuracy according to the user-specified scoring function.  <p> <pre><code>export(output_file_name)\n</code></pre></p>  Export the optimized pipeline as Python code.  See the usage documentation for example usage of the export function.  Parameters: output_file_name: string  String containing the path and file name of the desired output file  data_file_path: string  By default, the path of input dataset is 'PATH/TO/DATA/FILE' by default. If data_file_path is another string, the path will be replaced.  Returns: exported_code_string: string  The whole pipeline text as a string should be returned if output_file_name is not specified."},{"location":"citing/","title":"Citing TPOT","text":"<p>If you use TPOT in a scientific publication, please consider citing at least one of the following papers:</p> <p>Trang T.

However, if you don't run TPOT for long enough, it may not find the best possible pipeline for your dataset. It may even not find any suitable pipeline at all, in which case a <code>RuntimeError('A pipeline has not yet been optimized. Please call fit() first.')</code> will be raised. Often it is worthwhile to run multiple instances of TPOT in parallel for a long time (hours to days) to allow TPOT to thoroughly search the pipeline space for your dataset.</p> AutoML algorithms can take a long time to finish their search <p>AutoML algorithms aren't as simple as fitting one model on the dataset; they are considering multiple machine learning algorithms (random forests, linear models, SVMs, etc.) in a pipeline with multiple preprocessing steps (missing value imputation, scaling, PCA, feature selection, etc.), the hyperparameters for all of the models and preprocessing steps, as well as multiple ways to ensemble or stack the algorithms within the pipeline.</p> <p>As such, TPOT will take a while to run on larger datasets, but it's important to realize why. With the default TPOT settings (100 generations with 100 population size), TPOT will evaluate 10,000 pipeline configurations before finishing. To put this number into context, think about a grid search of 10,000 hyperparameter combinations for a machine learning algorithm and how long that grid search will take. That is 10,000 model configurations to evaluate with 10-fold cross-validation, which means that roughly 100,000 models are fit and evaluated on the training data in one grid search. That's a time-consuming procedure, even for simpler models like decision trees.</p> <p>Typical TPOT runs will take hours to days to finish (unless it's a small dataset), but you can always interrupt the run partway through and see the best results so far. TPOT also provides a <code>warm_start</code> parameter that lets you restart a TPOT run from where it left off.</p> AutoML algorithms can recommend different solutions for the same dataset <p>If you're working with a reasonably complex dataset or run TPOT for a short amount of time, different TPOT runs may result in different pipeline recommendations. TPOT's optimization algorithm is stochastic in nature, which means that it uses randomness (in part) to search the possible pipeline space. When two TPOT runs recommend different pipelines, this means that the TPOT runs didn't converge due to lack of time or that multiple pipelines perform more-or-less the same on your dataset.</p> <p>This is actually an advantage over fixed grid search techniques: TPOT is meant to be an assistant that gives you ideas on how to solve a particular machine learning problem by exploring pipeline configurations that you might have never considered, then leaves the fine-tuning to more constrained parameter tuning techniques such as grid search.</p>"},{"location":"using/#tpot-with-code","title":"TPOT with code","text":"<p>We've taken care to design the TPOT interface to be as similar as possible to scikit-learn.</p> <p>TPOT can be imported just like any regular Python module.

The option is for specifying a desired structure for the machine learning pipeline evaluated in TPOT. So far this option only supports linear pipeline structure. Each step in the pipeline should be a main class of operators (Selector, Transformer, Classifier or Regressor) or a specific operator (e.g. `SelectPercentile`) defined in TPOT operator configuration. If one step is a main class, TPOT will randomly assign all subclass operators (subclasses of [`SelectorMixin`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/feature_selection/base.py#L17), [`TransformerMixin`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.TransformerMixin.html), [`ClassifierMixin`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.ClassifierMixin.html) or [`RegressorMixin`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.RegressorMixin.html) in scikit-learn) to that step. Steps in the template are delimited by \"-\", e.g. \"SelectPercentile-Transformer-Classifier\". By default value of template is None, TPOT generates tree-based pipeline randomly.  See the  template option in tpot section for more details.  -memory MEMORY String or file path If supplied, pipeline will cache each transformer after calling fit.

Below is a list of the current built-in configurations that come with TPOT.</p> Configuration Name Description Operators Default TPOT TPOT will search over a broad range of preprocessors, feature constructors, feature selectors, models, and parameters to find a series of operators that minimize the error of the model predictions. Some of these operators are complex and may take a long time to run, especially on larger datasets.  Note: This is the default configuration for TPOT. To use this configuration, use the default value (None) for the config_dict parameter. Classification Regression TPOT light TPOT will search over a restricted range of preprocessors, feature constructors, feature selectors, models, and parameters to find a series of operators that minimize the error of the model predictions. Only simpler and fast-running operators will be used in these pipelines, so TPOT light is useful for finding quick and simple pipelines for a classification or regression problem.  This configuration works for both the TPOTClassifier and TPOTRegressor. Classification Regression TPOT MDR TPOT will search over a series of feature selectors and Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction models to find a series of operators that maximize prediction accuracy. The TPOT MDR configuration is specialized for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and is described in detail online here.  Note that TPOT MDR may be slow to run because the feature selection routines are computationally expensive, especially on large datasets. Classification Regression TPOT sparse TPOT uses a configuration dictionary with a one-hot encoder and the operators normally included in TPOT that also support sparse matrices.  This configuration works for both the TPOTClassifier and TPOTRegressor. Classification Regression TPOT NN TPOT uses the same configuration as \"Default TPOT\" plus additional neural network estimators written in PyTorch (currently only `tpot.builtins.PytorchLRClassifier` and `tpot.builtins.PytorchMLPClassifier`).  Currently only classification is supported, but future releases will include regression estimators. Classification TPOT cuML TPOT will search over a restricted configuration using the GPU-accelerated estimators in RAPIDS cuML and DMLC XGBoost. This configuration requires an NVIDIA Pascal architecture or better GPU with compute capability 6.0+, and that the library cuML is installed. With this configuration, all model training and predicting will be GPU-accelerated.  This configuration is particularly useful for medium-sized and larger datasets on which CPU-based estimators are a common bottleneck, and works for both the TPOTClassifier and TPOTRegressor.
