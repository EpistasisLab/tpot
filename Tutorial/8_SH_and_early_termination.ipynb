    "Population size is the number of individuals evaluated each generation. Budget refers to the proportion of data to sample. By manipulating these parameters, we can control how quickly the budget increases and how population size changes over time. Most often, this will be used to start the algorithm by evaluating a large number of pipelines on small subsets of the data to quickly narrow now best models, before later getting a better estimate with larger samples on fewer datasets. This can reduce overall computational cost by not spending as much time evaluating poor performing pipelines.\n",

    "`population_size` determines the number of individuals to evalaute each generation. Sometimes we may want to evaluate more or fewer individuals in the earlier generations. The `initial_population_size` parameter specifies the starting size of the population. The population size will gradually move from `initial_population_size` to `population_size` over the course of `generations_until_end_population` generations. `population_scaling` dictates how fast that scaling takes place. The interpolation over `generations_until_end_population` is done stepwise with the number of steps specified by `stepwise_steps`.\n",
