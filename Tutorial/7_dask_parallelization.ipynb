    "# Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers advanced setups for parallelizing TPOT with Dask. If you just want to parallelize TPOT within a single computer with multiple processes, set the n_jobs parameter to the number of threads you want to use and skip this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "TPOT uses Dask for parallelization and defaults to using a dask.distributed.LocalCluster for local parallelization. A user can pass in a custom Dask client or cluster for advanced usage. For example, a multi-node parallelization is possible using the dask-jobqueue package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TPOT can be easily parallelized on a local computer by setting the n_jobs and memory_limit parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`n_jobs` dictates how many dask workers to launch. In TPOT this corresponds to the number of pipelines to evaluate in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "`memory_limit` is the amount of RAM to use per worker. "

    "### TPOT with Python Scripts\n",

    "\n",
    "This is due to how parallelization is handled in Python. In short, when Python spawns new processes, each new process reimports code from the relevant .py files, including rerunning code. The context under `if __name__==\"__main__\":` ensures the code under it only executed by the main process and only once.
