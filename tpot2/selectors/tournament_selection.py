    Select the best individual among *tournsize* randomly chosen

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores : np.ndarray
        The score matrix, where rows the individuals and the columns are the corresponds to scores on different objectives.
    k : int
        The number of individuals to select.
    n_parents : int, optional
        The number of parents to select per individual. The default is 1.
    rng : int, np.random.Generator, optional
        The random number generator. The default is None.
    tournament_size : int, optional
        The number of individuals participating in each tournament.
    score_index : int, str, optional
        The index of the score to use for selection. If "average" is passed, the average score is used. The default is 0 (only the first score is used).
