    """Default scoring function: balanced accuracy.

    Balanced accuracy computes each class' accuracy on a per-class basis using a
    one-vs-rest encoding, then computes an unweighted average of the class accuracies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true: numpy.ndarray {n_samples}
        True class labels
    y_pred: numpy.ndarray {n_samples}
        Predicted class labels by the estimator

    Returns
    -------
    fitness: float
        Returns a float value indicating the `individual`'s balanced accuracy
        0.5 is as good as chance, and 1.0 is perfect predictive accuracy
